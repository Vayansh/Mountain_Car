# Mountain_Car
Creating a reinforcement learning model using Q-learning 

## Motive
To understand reinforcement Q-learning and how to implement the same. MeanWhile, understanding how to use OpenAI-GYM library.

## Idea
To use Mountain Car game from OpenAI-GYM library and implement the Q-learning reinforcement algorithm to play the game. 

## Approach
Using Greedy Epsilon Value algorithm, Q-value Action-value function, Mountain Car model of OpenAI-Gym to produce a reinforced model.
